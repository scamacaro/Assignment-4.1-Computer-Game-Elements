# Assignment-4.1-Computer-Game-Elements
Overview
The activity is designed to provide a vehicle to master Web forms and how to extract data from form fields.
Guidelines and Expectations
For this assignment we will be designing a form that will contain elements of a computer game.
You will create a new webpage that will ask the user to enter the appropriate information before they can begin the game.
The X entries typed into separate text fields will be the player's "username", the players "point total", "Health/Damage" and the "weapons" they want to use in the game.
These entries will be captured by your JavaScript form.
Create a "submit" button that once clicked, will output the 4 items to a separate text field/output area on the same page.
Example:

User Name	ninja
Weapons	invisibility
Health/Damage	50
Point Total	100
Deliverables
Submit a YouTube video link or screenshot(s) of the website in action!
Upload your files to GitHub and provide the link to your public repo.
